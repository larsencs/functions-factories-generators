## About The Project
This was an assignment during coding bootcamp.

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to learn about generator functions and how they keep track of their previous state across calls. This app has an array of reindeer and an array of colors. It renders the reindeer on HTML with each reindeer being a different color by utilizing the generator function to keep track of the previous color.
